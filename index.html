			<h2>Build an app that can help Leonard get Penny.</h2>

  			<h3>User Stories</h3>
  			<p><pre>As Leonard, I can view headlines from <a href="http://developer.espn.com/">ESPN</a>, so that I can keep up to date on the latest sports news.<ul>Acceptance Criteria: Information is refreshed every time the app is launched.</ul></pre></p>
  			<p><pre>As Leonard, I can select a favorite team, so that I can just read the headlines for my favorite team and not get overloaded with information about other teams.<ul>Acceptance Criteria: Favorite team is saved and persists even when the app is closed.</ul></pre></p>
  			<p><pre>As Leonard, I can read additional information about a team, so that I can learn more about the team and its history.</pre></p>
  			<p><pre>As Leonard, I can post a tweet so that Penny can read my awesome analysis of sports news.</pre></p>
  			<p><pre>As Leonard, I can find tickets to a game, so that I can plan a date for me and Penny.</pre></p>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
			
  			<p>Create an iOS app targeting iOS 7. When you are finished with the app, create a pull request to submit your app.</p>
  			<p>Not all the user stories are required, we understand that you have limited time.</p>
  			<p>The assumptions and details for the user stories are entirely up to you, add as much detail or as little detail as you like.</p>
  			<p>Style and design are also entirely up to you, make the entire app in black and white if you want.</p>
  			<p>If you are unable to finish a user story, add a comment to the pull request explaining how you were planning to code the user story and why you were unable to do it.</p>
  			<p>Bonus points for using our <a href="http://applico.github.io/BorealiOS/">BorealiOS</a> networking library.</p>
